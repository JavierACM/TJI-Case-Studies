# TJI-Case-Studies
This is a repository created to store the 2 case studies that I, along with 3 other researchers, made in partnership with the non-profit organization, the Texas Justice Initiative (TJI).

The 1st case study (Fall 2019) was made to analyze data over pre-booking deaths in Texas.

The 2nd case study (Spring 2020) was made to analyze data over prison deaths in Texas over a 10 year span.

The 1st case study was presented by my team and I and we won a $10,000 grant to continue our research with TJI, which resulted in our 2nd case study. This was when I was new to data analysis and as I have learned more over the years since these projects, I often look back to these projects and realize that there are better techniques and strategies we could have implemented to create a better project.
